# Walgreens Scraper
Have yourself logged in on the web or mobile app, ready to book the appointment when this beeps.

Edit the zipcodes in `./run` that you want to search. Seems like their 25mi radius is not accurate and is more like 5mi from experience seeing near by appointments detected.

- `npm install`
- `WALGREENS_USERNAME=myemail@amil.com WALGREENS_PASSWORD=mypassword ./run`
