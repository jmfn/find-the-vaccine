# Walgreens Scraper

Have yourself logged in on the web or mobile app, ready to book the appointment when this beeps.

Edit the zipcodes in `./run-wal` that you want to search. Seems like their 25mi radius is not accurate and is more like 5mi from experience seeing near by appointments detected.

- `WALGREENS_USERNAME=myemail@amil.com WALGREENS_PASSWORD=mypassword ./run-wal`

# CVS Scraper

Hardocded to Illinois in `src/cvs-il.js`, simply run

- `./run-cvs`
